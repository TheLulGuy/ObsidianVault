Today was a mad fun day, i should update my journal with it because writing is better than typing in an emotional sense

I also need to jot down some stuff that i thought might be useful for the future

If i get the pdf version of a JEE MCQs question bank, and then find out what word is repeated the most in each topic(For example, in quadratic equations the most repeated words will be 'Evaluate', 'Solve', and stuff like that). 
By doing so, i can effectively find out the most repeated type of ideology for each question and basically be ahead of 99% of my competition, those 1% of people are the fuckers who would have brute forced their way through 

- Invested in the Auto-File-Mover plugin, very peace. Gotta learn regex for it tho
- So, learn regex #todo
