Apparently the NHS mental health self-assessment test is gone, and i dont know why. So i did some other websites' test

My test results came out as this
Depression - 8 out of 27(30%)
Anxiety -  9 out of 21(42%)

I checked another website, and it came out as i have a 'Mild Indication of Depression'
Therefore it is not as severe as it used to be, but it still exists
