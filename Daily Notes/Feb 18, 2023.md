## NMC
Today, i wrote the entrance test for NMC, it was ok ok.
Some things were outta syllabus, but it is what it is and i doubt i will get any bad marks

I learnt about tags in Obsidian, and got to know about canvases. They are pretty goddamn sick, but i do not have any use for them other than goofing around, so i think i will just not do anything with them until i expand my Obsidian Vault enough for it to become useful


Get some quotes from Miyamoto Musashi, and Vikings(from that video) #todo
