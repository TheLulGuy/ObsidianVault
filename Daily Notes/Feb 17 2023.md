something is wrong i can feel it SUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIi

Today is the first day i used [[Obsidian]], it is actually a lot easier to use than Notion, but i somehow gotta move everything over here. 

Updated what i know in coding, only the modules part so far in python.

Update 2.0 - Added JEE Mains section, with each chapters made into a checklist, everything is peace
