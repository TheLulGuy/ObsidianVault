## Obsidian Zettelkasten method

The original zettelkasten note taking method had 3 different types of notes, to help you organize them:

- Fleeting notes - Basically a brain dump
- Literature notes - For articles, books, research
	- Writing things down in your own words
	- Copy pasting articles, etc.
	- Quotes
	- Book summaries(I have the real copy with me, should note them down here)
- Permanent notes - concrete notes, about ideas that *you will not change*
	- **Example** - a note on the 80-20 rule, and the 37% rule of thinking
	- Should be concise
