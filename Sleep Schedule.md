## Main things affecting sleep

- **Do you deseve the rest?**
	- If you feel like you haven't completely and fully lived for that day, sleeping at night on that day just feels a bit wrong. 
	- So just fully exert yourself that day. You will realize by yourself when to stop

- ***Are you tired in the first place?***
	- Same as the first point
	- If you arent even tired in the first place, you wont even sleep.
	- So whats the point in staying energized all day when you cant even sleep.
- **Electronics**
	- Mainly, your phone will not affect you as long as you dont watch anything psychologically triggering(horror, movies, arako TV shit, etc.)

- **Keep your bed clean and tidy**
	- DONT SLACK ON CLEANING YOUR BED PROPERLY
	- Psychologically and physically, if you sleep in a clean bed, you will feel and sleep better cuz its fucking clean

## Criteria for good sleep

### Cicardian rhythm
- Sleep at the same time(roughly), and wake up at the same time everyday
- __Even during weekends, no excuses there__

### Get sunlight first thing in the morning
- Look at the sky, look at your surrounding, and chillax
- The main thing is to trigger your brain to 'wake up', and you know it works
