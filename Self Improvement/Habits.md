## Creating habits

- ### 2 minute rule
	  There are 2 variations of the 2 minute rule, but they are very similar to each other
	- *Variation 1* 
	  If an activity takes 2 minutes to complete, do it immediately without even thinking about it
	- *Variation 2* 
	  If an impulsive activity takes more than 2 minutes to secure, your lizard brain will try and shift your attention to something better
	  You can use this as a way to make bad habits harder to pursue
- ### 21 day rule
	- Most habits take 21 days of consistent trying for it to become a *consistent habit*
	- You do not need to do it back to back, you can take *breaks of max 1 day*
