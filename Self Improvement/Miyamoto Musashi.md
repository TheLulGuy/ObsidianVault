# Dokkodo

*These quotes are all from Dokkodo, the book written by Miyamoto Musashi*
**Dokkodo** - *Path of loneliness*, *The Way to Go Forth Alone*, *The Way of Walking Alone*

**Reference** -  [[21 Principles of Dokkodo(Original)]]

## Main Principles of Dokkodo

1. Do not practice delusion unless it is beneficial for you or others, "accept everything just the way it is" 
2. Do not chase happiness or seek pleasure for its own sake
3. Do not rely on half-assed feelings, rely on rationality and true feelings
4. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world - this quote basically tells us that **we should not take ourselves too seriously**, and instead **focus more on the world around us**, and to appeciate its beauty and complexity
5. Desire, mostly of the extreme kind, is a cup that can never be filled. And when it is filled, you would have consumed your other parts of life to gain it, as a sort of sacrifice. But some desire is important for ambition, and ambition is nothing without action. "Be detached from desire your whole life long"
6. The past is history, the future is mystery, but the present is a gift. "Do not regret what you have done"
