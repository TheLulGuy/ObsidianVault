This is mostly a psychology trick, that helps your brain act like precisely under pre-determined situations.

## How to make an if-then rule
- I want to become a boxer, and for that i need discipline, grit and action. Therefore i need to make a few if-then rules
- Let us say that i need to get rid of eating junk food. So i can make this if-then statement --> "If i see junk food, then i will avoid it"
  With this statement, i have hardwired my brain to react a specific way to a specific situation, with no room for adjustment as it is already pre-determined 

### My own if-then rules
- If i am sitting down, then i will keep my posture straight
- If i feel thirsty, then i will drink water even if i need to get up and do it
- If i just woke up, then i will do my [[Morning Routine]]
