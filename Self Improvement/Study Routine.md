#selfimprovement 

## My main weakpoints

- ***Chemistry*** - I dont really like the subject, but the teachers are good so i actually dont mind studying it a bit more
- ***Physics*** - Fuck this shit, like genuienly soumya maam really screwed this up for me, but i gotta take responsibiilty and fix it instead of whining
- ***Maths*** - I have to solve more problems, and get more practice
- ***Computers*** - I gotta branch out, and focus on learning from professionals, *creativity can wait until you get better ideas*
- ***English*** - I am just purely neglecting the subject. I am bad at it because i dont take it seriously

## Version Alpha(The beninging)

- Choose a random subject using a spinning wheel, to focus on for the day
- Study for 1 hour, and then peace out for the day
- In the morning, you should focus on the incomplete project work for that subject
- Dont give excuses for a repeated day of the subject, **just do it**

- Goal is to finish one chapter, and use the 5-3-2 question rule(5 easy, 3 medium and 2 hard questions) to solve questions
