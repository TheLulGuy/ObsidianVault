#selfimprovement 
## Goal setting
- Whatever goal you have in mind, set 10x of it. You will learn more from your mistakes while chasing that goal than the success of achieving the lower goal
- This makes you more motivated, in the cases of relationships, fitness, work, etc.
- **DON'T BE SHY**
- Write down ***exactly*** what you want
- Have weekly goals as well
