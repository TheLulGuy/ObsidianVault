## Conditions required

To successfully implement a routine, I should:
- Make it simple to follow
- Set the bar low
- They should be flexible, meaning they shouldn't cover the entire day. Its a routine not a military schedule


## My routines
[[Morning Routine]]
[[Shutdown Routine]]
[[Exercise Routine]]
[[Study Routine]]
[[Leaving Routine]]


## Current day routine
1) Morning routine, and then eat breakfast
2) Do coding project for some time
3) Exercise routine
4) Chill
5) Eat lunch at 12:00 pm
6) Finish lunch by 12:30 pm
7) Leave for RRI internship at 12:45 pm
8) Return home by around 6 to 6 30
9) Follow [[Study Routine]]
10) Eat dinner
11) Chill for a bit
12) Follow [[Shutdown Routine]]

### Routine philosophy
- Since i have more energy in the morning, i will produce in the morning
- Then, in the night i will consume. Chill, study, learn a new skill, purely something that doesnt require my full output
